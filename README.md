## Features That Empower You 💪

WebX Journal is packed with groundbreaking features engineered for security, flexibility, and a superior user experience:

* **Zero External Dependencies for Data:** Crucially, there is **no backend server** involved in storing or managing your sensitive user data, including journal entries, master passwords, or encryption keys. The hosting environment's function is purely to serve the PWA's static files. 🚫☁️
* **Cutting-Edge Client-Side Encryption:**
    * Every character you type is **encrypted directly within your web browser** before it touches any storage medium. ✍️➡️🔒
    * We employ **AES-256-GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode) for strong confidentiality and data authenticity. This is military-grade protection for your thoughts. 🔐
    * Your encryption keys are powerfully derived from your unique **master password** using **Argon2**, a state-of-the-art, computationally formidable Key Derivation Function (KDF) designed for strong resistance against brute-force attacks. 🔑
    * Argon2 parameters are meticulously tuned to deliver **maximum security** without sacrificing performance on typical devices. ⚙️
    * For supreme security, the derived decryption key resides **ephemerally in the browser's memory** during your active session, being **securely purged** upon logout or session expiration (e.g., after 10 minutes of inactivity). 💨
* **Local-First Authentication & Storage:**
    * Your account is created locally on your device with a username and master password. No external accounts are required. 👤
    * **IndexedDB (Primary Local Storage):** Your encrypted journal entries and local user profile are primarily stored in your browser's IndexedDB. This powerful, persistent browser database provides ample capacity, smooth asynchronous operations, and full **offline access** capabilities for your PWA. 💾
* **Absolute Data Portability & Backup Control:**
    * **Local File Export:** Generate a **single, consolidated encrypted backup file** of all your journal entries and your local user profile. This file will be named `webx-journal-backup-YYYYMMDDHHMM.webx` and can be saved anywhere on your device using the system's intuitive file picker. This is your personal, portable archive. 📥
    * **Local File Import:** Effortlessly restore your journal by importing a previously exported consolidated `.webx` file. The app guides you through decrypting and repopulating your local IndexedDB. 📤
* **Structured & Organized Journaling:**
    * Supports creating multiple distinct journal entries per day. 🗓️
    * Entries are organized with a precise and consistent naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS_UserDefinedTitle.enc`. 🏷️
* **Intelligent Future-Proof Data Format:**
    * Every encrypted data object (journal entries, user profile, and the backup file itself) incorporates a **schema version number**. This forward-thinking design ensures that even if encryption methods or data structures evolve in future updates, your existing data remains fully accessible and migratable without any loss. 🚀
* **Robust User Experience:**
    * Clear, concise guidance is provided to users regarding data privacy, the critical role of the master password, and choices for data storage. 💡
    * Comprehensive error handling is implemented for storage operations (IndexedDB, file operations), providing actionable feedback to the user. ⚠️
    * Data integrity verification (checksums/hashes) is performed on encrypted data during import/restore operations to ensure completeness and prevent silent corruption. ✅
